NAME
    Catalyst::Controller::HTML::FormFu - Catalyst integration for
    HTML::FormFu

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp::Controller::My::Controller;
    
        use base 'Catalyst::Controller::HTML::FormFu';

        }

    You can also use specially-named actions that will only be called under
    certain circumstances.

        sub edit : Chained('group') : PathPart : Args(0) : FormConfig { }
    
        sub edit_FORM_VALID {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
        
            my $form  = $c->stash->{form};
            my $group = $c->stash->{group};
        
            $form->model->update( $group );
        
            $c->response->redirect( $c->uri_for( '/group', $group->id ) );
        }
    
        sub edit_FORM_NOT_SUBMITTED {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
        
            my $form  = $c->stash->{form};
            my $group = $c->stash->{group};
        
            $form->model->default_values( $group );
        }

METHODS
  form
    This creates a new HTML::FormFu object, passing as it's argument the
    contents of the "constructor" config value.

    This is useful when using the ConfigForm() or MethodForm() action
    attributes, to create a 2nd form which isn't populated using a
    config-file or method return value.

        sub foo : Local {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
        
            my $form = $self->form;
        }

    Note that when using this method, the form's query method is not
    populated with the Catalyst request object.

SPECIAL ACTION NAMES
    An example showing how a complicated action method can be broken down
    into smaller sections, making it clearer which code will be run, and
    when.

        sub edit : Local : FormConfig {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
        
            my $form  = $c->stash->{form};
            my $group = $c->stash->{group};
        
            $c->detach('/unauthorised') unless $c->user->can_edit( $group );
        
            if ( $form->submitted_and_valid ) {
                $form->model->update( $group );
            
                $c->response->redirect( $c->uri_for('/group', $group->id ) );
                return;
            }
            elsif ( !$form->submitted ) {
                $form->model->default_values( $group );
            }
        
            $self->_add_breadcrumbs_nav( $c, $group );
        }

    Instead becomes...

        sub edit : Local : FormConfig {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
        
            $c->detach('/unauthorised') unless $c->user->can_edit(
                $c->stash->{group}
            );
        }
    
        sub edit_FORM_VALID {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
        
            my $group = $c->stash->{group};
        
            $c->stash->{form}->model->update( $group );
        
            $c->response->redirect( $c->uri_for('/group', $group->id ) );
        }
    
        sub edit_FORM_NOT_SUBMITTED {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
        
            $c->stash->{form}->model->default_values(
                $c->stash->{group}
            );
        }
    
        sub edit_FORM_RENDER {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
        
            $self->_add_breadcrumbs_nav( $c, $c->stash->{group} );
        }

    For any action method that uses a "Form", "FormConfig" or "FormMethod"
    attribute, you can add extra methods that use the naming conventions
    below.

    These methods will be called after the original, plainly named action
    method.

  _FORM_VALID
    Run when the form has been submitted and has no errors.

  _FORM_SUBMITTED
    Run when the form has been submitted, regardless of whether or not there
    was errors.

  _FORM_COMPLETE
    For MultiForms, is run if the MultiForm is completed.

  _FORM_NOT_VALID
    Run when the form has been submitted and there were errors.

  _FORM_NOT_SUBMITTED
    Run when the form has not been submitted.

  _FORM_NOT_COMPLETE
    For MultiForms, is run if the MultiForm is not completed.

  _FORM_RENDER
    For normal "Form" base classes, this subroutine is run after any of the
    other special methods, unless "$form->submitted_and_valid" is true.

    For "MultiForm" base classes, this subroutine is run after any of the
    other special methods, unless "$multi->complete" is true.

CUSTOMIZATION
    You can set your own config settings, using either your controller
    config or your application config.

        $c->config( 'Controller::HTML::FormFu' => \%my_values );
    
        # or
    
        MyApp->config( 'Controller::HTML::FormFu' => \%my_values );
    
        # or, in myapp.conf
    
        <Controller::HTML::FormFu>
            default_action_use_path 1
        </Controller::HTML::FormFu>

  form_method
    Override the method-name used to create a new form object.

    See "form".

    Default value: "form".

  form_stash
    Sets the stash key name used to store the form object.

    Default value: "form".

  form_attr
    Sets the attribute name used to load the
    Catalyst::Controller::HTML::FormFu::Action::Form action.

    Default value: "Form".

  config_attr
    Sets the attribute name used to load the
    Catalyst::Controller::HTML::FormFu::Action::Config action.

    Default value: "FormConfig".

  method_attr
    Sets the attribute name used to load the
    Catalyst::Controller::HTML::FormFu::Action::Method action.

    Default value: "FormMethod".

  form_action
    Sets which package will be used by the Form() action.

    Probably only useful if you want to create a sub-class which provides
    custom behaviour.

    Default value: "Catalyst::Controller::HTML::FormFu::Action::Form".

  config_action
    Sets which package will be used by the Config() action.

    Probably only useful if you want to create a sub-class which provides
    custom behaviour.

    Default value: "Catalyst::Controller::HTML::FormFu::Action::Config".

  method_action
    Sets which package will be used by the Method() action.

    Probably only useful if you want to create a sub-class which provides
    custom behaviour.

    Default value: "Catalyst::Controller::HTML::FormFu::Action::Method".

  constructor
    Pass common defaults to the HTML::FormFu constructor.

    These values are used by all of the action attributes, and by the
    "$self->form" method.

    Default value: "{}".

  config_callback
    Arguments: bool

    If true, a coderef is passed to "$form->config_callback->{plain_value}"
    which replaces any instance of "__uri_for(URI)__" found in form config
    files with the result of passing the "URI" argument to "uri_for" in
    Catalyst.

    The form "__uri_for(URI, PATH, PARTS)__" is also supported, which is
    equivalent to "$c->uri_for( 'URI', \@ARGS )". At this time, there is no
    way to pass query values equivalent to "$c->uri_for( 'URI', \@ARGS,
    \%QUERY_VALUES )".

    The second codeword that is being replaced is "__path_to( @DIRS )__".
    Any instance is replaced with the result of passing the "DIRS" arguments
    to "path_to" in Catalyst. Don't use qoutationmarks as they would become
    part of the path.

    Default value: 1

  default_action_use_name
    If set to a true value the action for the form will be set to the
    currently called action name.

    Default value: "false".

  default_action_use_path
    If set to a true value the action for the form will be set to the
    currently called action path. The action path includes concurrent to
    action name additioal parameters which were code inside the path.

    Default value: "false".

    Example:

        action: /foo/bar
        called uri contains: /foo/bar/1
    
        # default_action_use_name => 1 leads to:
        $form->action = /foo/bar
    
        # default_action_use_path => 1 leads to:
        $form->action = /foo/bar/1

  model_stash
    Arguments: \%stash_keys_to_model_names

    Used to place Catalyst models on the form stash.

    If it's being used to make a DBIx::Class schema available for
    "options_from_model" in HTML::FormFu::Model::DBIC, for "Select" and
    other Group-type elements - then the hash-key must be "schema". For
    example, if your schema model class is "MyApp::Model::MySchema", you
    would set "model_stash" like so:

        <Controller::HTML::FormFu>
            <model_stash>
                schema MySchema
            </model_stash>
        </Controller::HTML::FormFu>

  context_stash
    To allow your form validation packages, etc, access to the catalyst
    context, a weakened reference of the context is copied into the form's
    stash.

        $form->stash->{context};

    This setting allows you to change the key name used in the form stash.

    Default value: "context"

  languages_from_context
    If you're using a L10N / I18N plugin such as Catalyst::Plugin::I18N
    which provides a "languages" method that returns a list of valid
    languages to use for the currect request - and you want to use formfu's
    built-in I18N packages, then setting "languages_from_context"

  localize_from_context
    If you're using a L10N / I18N plugin such as Catalyst::Plugin::I18N
    which provides it's own "localize" method, you can set
    localize_from_context to use that method for formfu's localization.

  request_token_enable
    If true, adds an instance of HTML::FormFu::Plugin::RequestToken to every
    form, to stop accidental double-submissions of data and to prevent CSRF
    attacks.

  request_token_field_name
    Defaults to "_token".

  request_token_session_key
    Defaults to "__token".

  request_token_expiration_time
    Defaults to 3600.

DISCONTINUED CONFIG SETTINGS
  config_file_ext
    Support for this has now been removed. Config files are now searched
    for, with any file extension supported by Config::Any.

  config_file_path
    Support for this has now been removed. Use
    "{constructor}{config_file_path}" instead.

CAVEATS
    When using the "Form" action attribute to create an empty form, you must
    call $form->process after populating the form. However, you don't need
    to pass any arguments to "process", as the Catalyst request object will
    have automatically been set in $form->query.

    When using the "FormConfig" and "FormMethod" action attributes, if you
    make any modifications to the form, such as adding or changing it's
    elements, you must call $form->process before rendering the form.
